## Exercise 1: Create components ([See attachment](https://github.com/OneAgencySE/react-night-starter/raw/master/exercises/Exercise%201.pdf))
You have been given the task of building the webshop Recat, which mainly deals with selling pictures on cats. You have now got the first sketch that is on a product in the webshop. Your task is to build this in the React framework.

***Things to consider before you begin are:***
- Can I divide the sketch into several components that can be reused later?
- What data do I need? - which data is likely to change.

## Bonus Exercise!
In the project there is a REST API that you can use to retrieve your data. Think how to use it in your webshop.
Â 
For your help, you have documentation for the API, link should be visible when you start your application. You can also find the code for the REST API in the folder api.
Â 
To make requests to the APO, I use a package called axios, you can read more about it here: https://github.com/axios/axios (You do not need to install the package, it already exists in the project)
